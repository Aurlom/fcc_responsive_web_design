        <h2>A timeline of Margaret Hamilton's life and achievements:</h2>
        <ul id="timeline-list">
          <li class="tl-item"><span class="year">1936</span> - Born in Paoli, Indiana.</li>
          <li class="tl-item"><span class="year">1958</span> - Graduated from Earlham College with a BA in mathematics and a minor in philosophy.</li>
          <li class="tl-item"><span class="year">1959</span> - Hamilton intended to continue her studies in mathematics, but began working for Edward Norton Lorenz at MIT developing meteorological software</li>
          <li class="tl-item"><span class="year">1961</span> - Begins work on SAGE at MIT for the U.S. Airforce. The project was an extension of MIT's weather tracking software "Project Whirlwind" adapted for the airforce for anti-air defense.</li>
          <li class="tl-item"><span class="year">1965</span> - Hamilton joins the MIT Instrumentation Laboratory and begins work on software for the Apollo Guidance Computer. She goes on to be the first programmer hired by NASA from MIT and the first female programmer on the Apollo project. She goes on to lead the team working on the lunar and command modules.</li>
          <li class="tl-item"><span class="year">1969</span> - The Apollo 11 mission. Hamilton had pioneered a "priority-display" system designed to interrupt the astronauts when the software encounters an error, and to switch over to new programs to continue operations. One such error occured during the descent of the lunar module, but the priority-display allowed them to get a "go" from mission control to land anyway on the back-up software.</li>
          <li class="tl-item"><span class="year">1976</span> - Hamilton co-founds a company with Saydean Zeldin, Higher Order Software, to develop their ideas about error prevention and fault tolerance.</li>
          <li class="tl-item"><span class="year">1986</span> - Hamilton founds Hamilton Technologies to develop Universal Systems Language</li>
          <li class="tl-item"><span class="year">2016</span> - Hamilton receives the Presidential Medal of Freedom from President Barrack Obama in recognition of her contributions to the field</li>
        </ul>

          <p>"Three minutes before Armstrong and Aldrin touched down on the moon, Apollo 11's lunar lander alarms triggered red and yellow lights across the board. Our astronauts  didn't have much time, but thankfully, they had Margaret Hamilton."</p>
          <p>-- President Barrack Obama</p>
